If cart drawer empty, show most popular product inside it with ability to add it to the cart.

 You can use product\_url.js to fetch the data you need. For example:
[https://blank-sunglasses.com/products/john.js](https://blank-sunglasses.com/products/john.js)

 Please check Shopify Cart API how to add variant to the cart with JS:
[https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart)

Test should execute whenever cart drawer empty, not on page load.

**TASK 2 – build infinite scroll instead of pagination**

**Task description:** In this task you have to build infinite scroll instead of pagination. When user scrolls down before last line of products, new set of products will be appended to the list of products. Pay attention on filters because when you filter products, list should update and infinite scroll should work with filtered products. When you load all the products display message "All products loaded." below the products. ![](RackMultipart20230924-1-h9k0rt_html_86a0a24e10bb819.png)
